                In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more
    quantities, sometimes as described by a wave equation. In physical waves, at least two field quantities in the wave medium are
    involved. Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some
    frequency. When the entire waveform moves in one direction it is said to be a traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed
    periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave. In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at
    some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero.

    The types of waves most commonly studied in classical physics are mechanical and electromagnetic. In a mechanical wave, stress
    and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium. A mechanical wave is a local deformation (strain) in some physical medium
    that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too. For example, sound
    waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that propagate through the medium. Other examples of mechanical
    waves are seismic waves, gravity waves, surface waves, string vibrations (standing waves), and vortices[dubious – discuss]. In an
    electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave
    involving these fields according to Maxwell's equations. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum and through some
    dielectric media (at wavelengths where they are considered transparent). Electromagnetic waves, according to their frequencies (or
    wavelengths) have more specific designations including radio waves, infrared radiation, terahertz waves, visible light, ultraviolet
    radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

    Other types of waves include gravitational waves, which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate according to general relativity;
    heat diffusion waves[dubious – discuss]; plasma waves that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; reaction–
    diffusion waves, such as in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction; and many more.
